ChatCommands Bukkit plugin is braught to you by notaro1997. All code for this plugin is open source, however may NOT be used withough DIRECT 
permission from notaro1997. ChatCommands Bukkit plugin is a rolling plugin, updates will continue to come out. Each command in this plugin has

for example, for the command /ban, the permission is notaro.ban, and for /info it is notaro.info. There is a list on the Bukkit page for this plugin, 
though I do beleive it can be figured out. Donations would be appriciated. More infomation can be found at http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/chatcommands/
